## Lab 1.2 — React as the View Layer

In this lab, the React project for the counter demonstrates how React acts as the “view layer” that turns state into user interface. The main `Counter` component stores a numeric value in `useState`, and its JSX describes how the UI should look for a given value: a heading, the current count, and two buttons. When React renders the component, it creates a virtual DOM tree that represents this structure. The browser initially receives a basic HTML shell (from Vite’s `index.html`), and React takes over the `<div id="app">` element by mounting the component tree into it. This matches Chapter 1’s description that React focuses purely on rendering and updating the view based on data and state, without including routing, data fetching, or other application concerns.

When a user clicks **Increment** or **Decrement**, the corresponding click handler calls `setValue`, updating the component’s state. React schedules a re‑render: it calls the `Counter` function again with the new state, produces a new virtual DOM tree, and then runs its diffing and patching algorithm. Instead of replacing the whole DOM subtree, React compares the previous and next virtual DOM representations and applies only the minimal updates (for example, updating the text node that displays the current value). This is the “virtual DOM” and diffing behavior discussed in Chapter 1’s “Performance matters” section, and it helps keep UI updates efficient even as the component tree grows.

This project also illustrates the idea that “React is just the view layer.” All of the logic here is about displaying and updating UI in response to state; there is no built‑in routing, global state management, or HTTP code in the framework. If we needed additional features, we would integrate other libraries on top of this view layer. Setting up the project with Vite and TypeScript follows the guidance from “Setting up a new React project”: the bundler handles module resolution and dev tooling, while React remains the focused UI library that turns state into a predictable, declarative interface for the user.
