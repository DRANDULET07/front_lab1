# Lab 1.2 — React Project Setup & Counter

This folder contains the React project for **Lab 1.2**: a minimal counter app demonstrating the React view layer, state, and re‑rendering.

## Project structure

- `react-counter/` — Vite + TypeScript + React project with the `Counter` component rendered from `src/main.tsx`.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 10+

Locally (when this project was created) the commands were:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

Use your own local versions in the report/README if they are different.

## How to run the app

1. Open a terminal in `Lab_01/task2/react-counter`.
2. Install dependencies (only needed once):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the printed local URL (for example `http://localhost:5173`) in the browser.
5. Use **Increment** and **Decrement** to change the counter value and see React re‑render the UI.
